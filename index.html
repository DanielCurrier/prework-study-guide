        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> If an application is a movie, then HTML is the script. It is the blueprint that provides structure to the greater whole.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li> the style element defines the CSS styles aattached to the website.</li>
          <li> The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to an HTML document. This is used for this website to add CSS and JavaScript to the site!</li>
          <li> The meta element defines metadata such as character set, description, keywords, author and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li> HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element. They are NEVER defined in the closing element!</li>

      <h2> CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are three ways to use CSS to style a webpage: inline CSS, internal CSS and external CSS.</li>
        <li>External CSS is the most forgiving of the styles as it does not directly bake itself into the HTML file of an application.</li>
        <li> The link function in HTML is used to apply the CSS style sheet to the website, making it simpler to code.</li>
        <li> How to code a CSS rule: div(selector) {color (property): blue (value); text-align(property): justify(value);}</li> 
        <li> As stated above, a selector defines the element or attribute to which  the rules or declarations will apply.</li>
        <li> A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li> 
      </ul>

        <li>Git is a free version control software that allows you to develop applications on your desktop.</li>
        <li> GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for your web applications.</li>
        <li>Git Workflow: "git status" to verify location -> "cd" to change directory if needed ->  </li> 
        <li>"git checkout -b feature/(insert-name)" To create a new branch -> "git add -A" to stage changes -></li>

        <li>Goto GitHub to confirm and merge pull request. Don't forget to add comments!</li>
        <li> Use "git checkout main" to return to the main branch once you are finished with your feature branch.</li>
        <li> Use "git pull origin main" to sync with cloud changes on the main branch.</li>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>Separation of concerns: refers to separating code into different files based on use;based on the concept that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
        <li> DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself): a coding concept that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that neeeds to be written.</li>
        <li> Array: a single variable that holds a group of data; This can store multiple items such as strings, numbers and booleans.</li>
        <li>Function: a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
        <li>To declare a function, use the "function" keyword followed by the variable you wish to define (ex. function MakePancakes() ).</li>
        <li> Index: number associated with an item in an array, starts at 0.</li>
        <li>"for" loop: Uses indices to perform tasks in an array, allowing a single line of code to be executed over and over.</li>
        <li> The first statement in the loop indicates the starting point, defines a variable and its value (var x=0).</li>
        <li> The second statement is the condition (as long as x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running).</li>
        <li>The final statement allows the array to iterate over each item ("x++" is shorthand for x+1, which is used in this example).</li>
        <li> Control flow dictates that JavaScript files are executed from top to bottom.</li>
