# Dan Currier's Prework Study Guide
## Description
This study guide was developed as a means of aiding Columbia University's coding bootcamp students through their Prework phase of the program. The guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. As a fledgling bootcamp student, starting out can be challenging, and with this program I aim to help not only myself, but to others who may find this information useful. To those who are in a similar position reading this, I hope that these notes will porvide valuable insight into the foundations of this program!
